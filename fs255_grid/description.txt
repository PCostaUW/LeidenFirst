A new set of stellar tracks and isochrones for LOW MASS STARS is available
(see Spada, F.,Demarque, P.,Kim, Y.-C. & Sills, A. 2013, ApJ, 776, 87)   

Evolutionary tracks for models in the range 0.10--1.25 Msun, with various 
values of the mixing length parameter alpha_MLT = 0.5, 1.0, 1.875, 3.0, 
and various chemical composition ([Fe/H] = +0.3, 0.0, -0.5, -1.0, -1.5, 
enrichment parameter Delta Y /Delta Z = 1.48, alpha-enhancement 
[alpha/Fe] = 0; the Grevesse & Sauval 1998 (Z/X)_sun = 0.0230 is assumed) 
are available. Diffusion of helium and of the heavy elements is taken into 
account; core overshooting is ignored. The evolutionary tracks cover the 
PMS and the post-MS up to 13 Gyr and/or the sub giant phase (if present). 

Along with the standard input physics incorporated in the non-rotational 
version of YREC (see Demarque et al., 2008, for details), 
these new calculations feature two major improvements which are especially 
relevant to models of mass lower than 0.6 Msun:

(1) to take care of the (relatively) low temperatures and high densities in 
the atmospheres of such stars, the SCVH equation of state (Saumon et al. 1995) 
is ramped with the OPAL 2005 equation of state below 5000 K;

(2) as the grey atmosphere approximation becomes increasingly inadequate at 
about 0.6 Msun and moving towards lower masses, the surface boundary 
conditions have been specified based on the BT-Settl PHOENIX non-grey 
atmospheric models (Allard et al., 2011).  

Theoretical isochrones, along with synthetic magnitudes obtained from the 
color--effective temperature transformations of Lejeune et al. (1998) and 
VandenBerg & Clem (2003), are also available.
